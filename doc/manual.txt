The year is 1999. Earth has entrusted you to establish the Helix Colony in the
Procyon system.

* Explore the planet
* Build gamma mines
* Protect your crew

You have sixty days.

DIRECTIVE: EXPLORE THE PLANET

Use the joystick to move your craft around the planet in four directions. Each
move consumes one energy. If you have 0 energy, your craft cannot move.

Your craft is equipped with a sensor that records its readings on your 
PlanetDisplay. It tells you how many gamma geisers are adjacent to your craft,
up to four. The current reading is in the lower left-hand corner of your
PlanetDisplay.


DIRECTIVE: BUILD GAMMA MINES

Your survival depends on energy self-sufficiency. Your Hab landed with a limited
amount of energy, so you must build gamma geisers over gamma mines to sustain
the colony. The Hab itself consumes one energy per day.

When you think you know where a gamma geiser is located, based on sensor
readings, press the Fire button. Your ship will land. Move the joystick toward
the sector on which you want to build a gamma geiser. A gamma mine costs 50
energy to build.

If you built the mine on a geiser, the mine will produce an extra 3 energy per
day, which you can use to explore and build additional mines.

If you built the mine anywhere else, it will not produce energy.


DIRECTIVE: PROTECT YOUR CREW

Unfortunately, gamma geisers are invisible to the eye. If you fly your craft
over one, the ship and its pilot will be destroyed. Only six of you made the
trip, so heed your sensor readings!

You can safely fly your craft over gamma mines.


EVALUATION

After sixty days, your colony will be evaluated.

* You will score 50 bonus energy for each remaining crew member
* You will score 50 bonus energy for each successful gamma mine
* If your entire crew is killed before sixty days, the game ends with no bonuses
* The game will also end without bonuses if you run out of energy with no mines
